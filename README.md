Belljar is a project developed within CosRad (Consortium of Spacesuit Research and Development)

It contains a pair of packages for generic thermofluid solving, either in steady-state (belljar-fruitloop) or timestepping (belljar-lockstep) modes.

Belljar is suitable for the simulation of ISRU, ECLSS, PLSS and thermal control systems in space or analagous applications on Earth.

The Belljar repository includes the belljar-metman code, a complete implementation of NASA's 41-Node Man spacesuit thermal simulator, using the Belljar framework for thermodynamic solving.
